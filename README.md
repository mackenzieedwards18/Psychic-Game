This is a game where the computer picks a random letter and you have 9 chances to guess the same letter that the computer chose. If you do not guess the correct letter after 9 tries you lose and the game restarts. If you guess the right letter before the 9 tries are up, you win and the game restarts. Your wins and loses will be kept track of on the screen.
